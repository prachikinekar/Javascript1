// Function Declaration with parameters:

// Can call function declaration before the function defination, bcoz function declaration are fully hoisted in 1. memory creation phase

funOne(10,10);//20 >Before calling

function funOne(a,b){
    console.log(a+b);
}

funOne(1,1);//2 >after calling

// funOne is a function name which acting as a variable whos holding function as a value

console.log(funOne);//[Function: funOne]

// EC have 2 phases:>1.Memory creation 2.Code execution 
// At time of code execution functio declaration getting fully hoisted at time of memory creation phase hence we can able to call it before the function declaration

// Check for return keyword
